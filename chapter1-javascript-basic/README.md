# Chapter 1 - Javascript Basic

React is Javascript library based on Node.js

Javascript is compiled by `Javascript Engine`

Basically, every web browser has a Javascript Engine.

You must run Javascript code in a web browser, unless you use a different environment such as Node.js

Chrome is most widely used web browser, which utilizes the V8 Engine.

When you use Chrome Developer Tools, you can only run code one line at a time.
So we recommend to use a third party web editor like `https://codesandbox.io`
